ProCoDA is an easily configured process control and data acquisition software and hardware that enhances experimental evaluation of unit processes and permits fully automated parametric studies. The ProCoDA software is a LabVIEW executable, however LabVIEW is not accessible to all due to its cost. Therefore, the goal of the ProCoDA Python transition subteam is to transition the software to Python so more universities and researchers can use ProCoDA.
